# throttle.py

Example code for discussion and presentation purposes.

Requires:
- https://pypi.org/project/decorator
- https://pypi.org/project/redis  (or another "lockable" cache)

Also imports from my cache lib (https://github.com/newbery/example-cache). I should probably remove this dependency.

The usage and software contract is reasonably well-documented in the tests module.
If anything is unclear, please feel free to ping me.
